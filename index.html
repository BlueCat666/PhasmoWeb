                    ghost event. When it does so, it will leave an EMF reading at the player location then walk back to
                    it's room. After teleporting, Wraith can interact with objects, do ghost events, or even hunt before
                    going back to it's room. Wraith can be found pretty far from it's favorite room. <br><span

                    faster.</li>

                <li class="add-info"><span>Unique/Hidden Power/Descriptions:</span> Phantom will disappear immediately
                    after taking a photo of it during a ghost event, and often continue making noise while invisible.
                    When taking a photo of the Phantom in the DOTS state, it will also disappear. The ghost will not
                    show up in the actual photo. When hunting it will be more invisible while flashing than other
                    ghosts. Phantoms like to follow players around. To help keep the phantom near its room, have all
                    party members stick together. This will make evidence and objectives easier to get. <a

            <ul>
                <li class="strength"><span>Strength:</span> Poltergeists can throw multiple objects at once, and with
                    great force.</li>
                <li class="weakness"><span>Weakness:</span> With nothing to throw, the Poltergeist becomes powerless.

                    during hunts.</li>
                <li class="hunts-at"><span>Hunts at:</span> 50% sanity</li>
                <li class="add-info"><span>Unique/Hidden Power/Descriptions:</span> The Poltergeist has a chance to
                    throw many objects at once, greatly decreasing player sanity by 2% per item thrown. Poltergeist also
                    throws objects more often than other ghosts both normally and during the hunt. It has a 100% chance
                    to throw an object nearby during a hunt every .5 seconds, compared to 50% for other ghosts. In the
                    Apocalypse update, Polty was given the Oni ability to throw things harder. It can now throw things
                    at a power of 2-6 compared to 0-3 for all other ghosts. To determine Poltergeist, make piles of
                    multiple items and see if it throws all at once. <a class="yt-link"

                <li class="weakness"><span>Weakness:</span> Banshee can sometimes be heard screaming with parabolic
                    Microphone.</li>

                <li class="hunts-at"><span>Hunts at:</span> Banshee hunts based off of target's sanity. Hunts at 50%
                    target sanity. Ignores average sanity.</li>
                <li class="add-info"><span>Unique/Hidden Power/Descriptions:</span> The Banshee will only target one
                    player for the duration of the run as long as that player is alive and inside the house. If the
                    target is outside the house, the banshee will hunt normally. If the player dies, Banshee will select
                    a new target.<br>
                    <span class="ghost-note">Fact: If the target is above 50% sanity, whether inside the house or not, the banshee cannot hunt.</span>
