                    to throw an object nearby during a hunt every .5 seconds, compared to 50% for other ghosts. In the
                    Apocalypse update, Polty was given the Oni ability to throw things harder. It can now throw things
                    at a power of 2-6 compared to 0-3 for all other ghosts. To determine Poltergeist, make piles of

                    spirit box or parabolic mic response with double the passive sanity drain. Lights and Candles do not
                    stop the cursed sanity drain. When outside the house the curse is paused. Taking sanity pills will
                    remove the curse. Smudging during the hunt will blind the Moroi for 7.5 seconds instead of 5 for all
                    other ghosts. Moroi is faster the lower your sanity is, varying from 1.5 m/s at its slowest up to
                    2.25 m/s at its fastest. Test...if you get a spirit box response, grab a candle and head into the
                    house. If candle does not slow sanity drain, it's a Moroi. <span class="ghost-note">Always has sprit

                    ghost. Starting hunt threshold is 75% dropping all the way down to a minimum of 15%. Thaye lower its
                    speed when it ages. Starting at 2.7m/s and lowering to a minimum of 1m/s
                    Each age lowers the speed by 0.175m/s. No Line of sight acceleration. When asking "How old are you"
                    on the ouija board, the Thaye will respond differently depending on it's age.
